# 319SBA
I did a lot of things and got things working, but i had a hard time with my git file, but now i have everything i need. I'm going to eventually use this project towards my final project, so I won't give too much away.

I installed express, mongo, mongoose, jsx view engine, and method override.

I created a database with the connection script file. I created 3 models for this project (flavor, topping, and schedule) that will allow customers to create, delete, and play aorund to see some things my company has available. 

So far typing in localhost:5050, the browser will show the title and three links. The Flavors (snow cone syrup) link is working; it shows the flavor index page, create a new flavor link, a link about the flavor, an edit link, and a delete link. All are not running properly yet, but created!

Create a new flavor is working properly
